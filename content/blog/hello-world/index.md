description: The first commit to a new world of content creation.

The reason I created this blog was to add incentive to personal project creation, learning, to further my involvement with the development community, and to create an online presence.
I am hoping to create a rich engaging content to help the learning and development of those interested in learning the wonderful world of web development.

Stay tuned for my first project blog: creating a battleship game with React.js.
